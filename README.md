## Introduction
ECG signals are widely used in medical diagnostics to assess cardiac health. This code aims to provide tools for analyzing ECG signals, extracting relevant features, and classifying heart rate patterns.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- **NumPy** (Version 1.21.3)
- **Pandas** (Version 1.3.4)
- **Matplotlib** (Version 3.4.3)
- **SciPy** (Version 1.7.3)
- **Scikit-learn** (Version 0.24.2)
- **TensorFlow** (Version 2.6.0)
- **Neurokit2** (Version 0.1.1)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`. Here's the command:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (see Dependencies).
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script ecg_analysis.py:
bash
Copy code
python ecg_analysis.py
This script will generate an animated plot showing the ECG signal analysis in real-time.

## Features

Real-time ECG signal simulation and analysis.
Computation of heart rate statistics, including mean, maximum, and minimum heart rates.
Calculation of heart rate variability.
SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) calculation.
Machine learning-based heart rate classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
Clustering and visualization of heart rate and SNR data.

## How it Works

The code simulates ECG signals, applies signal processing techniques, and computes various ECG features. These features are used for heart rate classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. The code also clusters the ECG features to visualize different heart rate patterns.

## Results

The animated plot generated by the code provides real-time insights into ECG signal analysis. You can observe changes in heart rate statistics, SNR, and the model's heart rate classification probability as the simulation progresses.
